3.  Definition of Microfinance Loan 
3.1 A microfinance loan is defined as a collateral-free loan given to a household having 
annual household income up to ₹3,00,000.  For this purpose, the household shall mean 
an individual family unit, i.e., husband, wife and their unmarried children.  
3.2 All collateral-free loans, irrespective of end use and mode of application/ processing/ 
disbursal (either through physical or digital channels), provided to low-income 
households, i.e., households having annual income up to ₹3,00,000, shall be considered 
as microfinance loans. 
3.3 To ensure collateral-free nature of the microfinance loan, the loan shall not be linked 
with a lien on the deposit account of the borrower. 
3.4 The REs shall have a board-approved policy to provide the flexibility of repayment 
periodicity on microfinance loans as per borrowers’ requirement. 
4. Assessment of Household Income 
4.1 Each RE shall put in place a board-approved policy for assessment of household 
income. An indicative methodology for assessment of household income is provided in 
Annex I. 
4.2 Self-regulatory organisations (SROs) and other associations/ agencies may also 
develop a common framework based on the indicative methodology. The REs may adopt/ 
modify this framework suitably as per their requirements with approval of their boards.  
4.3 Each RE shall mandatorily submit information regarding household income to the 
Credit Information Companies (CICs). Reasons for any divergence between the already 
reported household income and assessed household income shall be specifically 
ascertained from the borrower/s before updating the assessed household income with 
CICs. 
5. Limit on Loan Repayment Obligations of a Household  
5.1 Each RE shall have a board-approved policy regarding the limit on the outflows on 
account of repayment of monthly loan obligations of a household as a percentage of the 


## Page 4

 
 
4 
 
 
monthly household income. This shall be subject to a limit of maximum 50 per cent of the 
monthly household income. 
5.2 The computation of loan repayment obligations shall take into account all outstanding 
loans (collateral-free microfinance loans as well as any other type of collateralized loans) 
of the household. The outflows capped at 50 per cent of the monthly household income 
shall include repayments (including both principal as well as interest component) towards 
all existing loans as well as the loan under consideration. 
5.3 Existing loans, for which outflows on account of repayment of monthly loan obligations 
of a household as a percentage of the monthly household income exceed the limit of 50 
per cent, shall be allowed to mature. However, in such cases, no new loans shall be 
provided to these households till the prescribed limit of 50 per cent is complied with. 
5.4 Each RE shall provide timely and accurate data to the CICs and use the data available 
with them to ensure compliance with the level of indebtedness. Besides, the RE shall also 
ascertain the same from other sources such as declaration from the borrowers, their bank 
account statements and local enquiries. 
6. Pricing of Loans 
6.1 Each RE shall put in place a board-approved policy regarding pricing of microfinance 
loans which shall, inter alia, cover the following: 
(i) A well-documented interest rate model/ approach for arriving at the all-inclusive 
interest rate;  
(ii) Delineation of the components of the interest rate such as cost of funds, risk premium 
and margin, etc. in terms of the quantum of each component based on objective 
parameters; 
(iii) The range of spread of each component for a given category of borrowers; and 
(iv)  A ceiling on the interest rate and all other charges applicable to the microfinance 
loans. 
6.2 Interest rates and other charges/ fees on microfinance loans should not be usurious. 
These shall be subjected to supervisory scrutiny by the Reserve Bank.

6.6 There shall be no pre-payment penalty on microfinance loans. Penalty, if any, for 
delayed payment shall be applied on the overdue amount and not on the entire loan 
amount. 
6.7 Each RE shall prominently display the minimum, maximum and average interest rates 
charged on microfinance loans in all its offices, in the literature (information booklets/ 
pamphlets) issued by it and details on its website. This information shall also be included 
in the supervisory returns and subjected to supervisory scrutiny. 
6.8 Any change in interest rate or any other charge shall be informed to the borrower well 
in advance and these changes shall be effective only prospectively.  
6.9 As part of their awareness campaigns, SROs/ other industry associations may publish 
the range of interest rates on microfinance loans charged by their members operating in 
a district. SROs/ other industry associations may also sensitize their members against 
charging of usurious interest rates. 
6.10 RBI would also make available information regarding interest charged by REs on 
microfinance loans.

and easier to understand language, provided to the borrower in a standardised format. 
(c) Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual cost of credit to the borrower which 
includes interest rate and all other charges associated with the credit facility. 
(d) Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI) is an equated or fixed amount of repayments, 
consisting of both the principal and interest components, to be paid by a borrower towards 
repayment of a loan at periodic intervals for a fixed number of such intervals; and which 
result in complete amortisation of the loan. EPIs at monthly intervals are called EMIs. 
Other words and expressions not defined above, but used in this para, shall have the 
same meaning as assigned to them under the Master Direction on Interest Rate on 
Advances (2016) as updated from time to time or any other relevant regulation issued by 
the Reserve Bank. 
6A.2 REs shall provide a KFS to all prospective borrowers to help them take an informed 
view before executing the loan contract, as per the standardised format given in the 
Annex IA. The KFS shall be written in a language understood by such borrowers. 
Contents of KFS shall be explained to the borrower and an acknowledgement shall be 
obtained that he/she has understood the same.

Explanation: Validity period refers to the period available to the borrower, after being 
provided the KFS by the RE, to agree to the terms of the loan. The RE shall be bound by 
the terms of the loan indicated in the KFS, if agreed to by the borrower during the validity 
period. 
6A.4 The KFS shall also include a computation sheet of annual percentage rate (APR), 
and the amortisation schedule of the loan over the loan tenor. APR will include all charges 
which are levied by the RE. Illustrative examples of calculation of APR and disclosure of

repayment schedule for a hypothetical loan are given in Annex II and Annex III 
respectively. 
6A.5 Charges recovered from the borrowers by the REs on behalf of third-party service 
providers on actual basis, such as insurance charges, legal charges etc., shall also form 
part of the APR and shall be disclosed separately. In all cases wherever the RE is involved 
in recovering such charges, the receipts and related documents shall be provided to the 
borrower for each payment, within a reasonable time. 
6A.6 Any fees, charges, etc. which are not mentioned in the KFS, cannot be charged by 
the REs to the borrower at any stage during the term of the loan, without explicit consent 
of the borrower.

8. Qualifying Assets Criteria 
8.1 Under the earlier qualifying assets criteria3, a Non-banking Financial Company -
Microfinance Institution (NBFC-MFI) is required to have minimum 85 per cent of its net 
assets4 as ‘qualifying assets’. The definition of ‘qualifying assets’ of NBFC-MFIs is now 
being aligned with the definition of ‘microfinance loans’ given at paragraph 3 above. The 
minimum requirement of microfinance loans for NBFC-MFIs also stands revised to 75 per 
cent of the total assets. 
8.2 Under the earlier guidelines, an NBFC that does not qualify as an NBFC-MFI, cannot 
extend microfinance loans exceeding 10 per cent of its total assets. The maximum limit 
on microfinance loans for such NBFCs (i.e., NBFCs other than NBFC-MFIs) now stands 
revised to 25 per cent of the total assets. 
 
 
3 In order to be classified as a ‘qualifying asset’, a loan is required to satisfy the following criteria: 
(i) Loan which is disbursed to a borrower with household annual income not exceeding ₹1,25,000 and ₹2,00,000 for 
rural and urban/semi-urban households, respectively; 
(ii) Loan amount does not exceed ₹75,000 in the first cycle and ₹1,25,000 in subsequent cycles; 
(iii) Total indebtedness of the borrower does not exceed ₹1,25,000 (excluding loan for education and medical 
expenses); 
(iv) Minimum tenure of 24 months for loan amount exceeding ₹30,000; 
(v) Collateral free loans without any prepayment penalty; 
(vi) Minimum 50 per cent of aggregate amount of loans for income generation activities; and 
(vii) Flexibility of repayment periodicity (weekly, fortnightly or monthly) at borrower’s choice. 
4 Net assets have been defined as total assets other than cash, bank balances and money market instruments.

9. Exemption for ‘Not for Profit’ Companies engaged in Microfinance Activities 
9.1 The definition of microfinance loans for ‘not for profit’ companies (registered under 
Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013) is now aligned with the revised definition of 
microfinance loans viz., collateral-free loans to households with annual household income 
up to ₹3,00,000, provided the monthly loan obligations of a household does not exceed 
50 per cent of the monthly household income. 
9.2 Exemptions from Sections 45-IA5, 45-IB6 and 45-IC7 of the RBI Act, 1934 have been 
withdrawn for those ‘not for profit’ companies engaged in microfinance activities that have 
asset size of ₹100 crore and above.  
9.3 ‘Not for profit’ companies that are not eligible for the exemptions mentioned at 
paragraph 9.2 above, are required to register as NBFC-MFIs and adhere to the 
regulations applicable to NBFC-MFIs. Such companies shall submit the application for 
registration as an NBFC-MFI to the Reserve Bank within three months of the issuance of 
this circular. Those companies that currently do not comply with the regulations 
prescribed for NBFC-MFIs, shall submit a board-approved plan, with a roadmap to meet 
the prescribed regulations, along with their application for registration. 
10. Net Owned Fund (NOF) Requirement  
Existing NBFC-MFIs shall adhere to the NOF glidepath indicated under paragraph 3.1 (a) 
of the Circular dated October 22, 2021 on ‘Scale Based Regulation (SBR): A Revised 
Regulatory Framework for NBFCs’ as given below:

Annex I 
(cf. Para 4.1 of these Directions) 
Indicative Methodology for Household Income Assessment 
1. For undertaking the income assessment of a low-income household, information 
related to following parameters may be captured by the lender: 
(i) Parameters to capture household profile

items, etc.) 
(ii) Parameters to capture household income 
a) Primary source of income  
i. 
Sector of work (Agriculture & allied activities, trading, manufacturing, services, etc.) 
ii.

c) The income assessment as above may be carried out for all earning members with 
respect to all sources (primary or secondary) of income. While assessing income of 
all members from all sources, it may be ensured that there is no double counting of 
income such as counting of salary income of one migrant member also as remittance 
income for the household. 
d) While the income computation may be done on a monthly basis, the income 
assessment for all members and sources may be carried out over a period of minimum 
one year to ascertain the stability of the household income. 
(iii) Parameters to capture household expenses 
a) Regular monthly expenses (food, utilities, transport, house/ shop rent, clothing, regular 
medical costs, school/ college fees, etc.) 
b) Irregular expenses over last one year (medical expenses, house renovation, purchase 
of household goods, functions, etc.) 
2.  Self-reported income at 1(ii) above may be corroborated with the profile of household 
at 1(i) and household expenses at 1(iii). Further, household income may also be verified 
from other sources (bank account statements of the borrowers, group members, other 
references in the vicinity, etc.).
