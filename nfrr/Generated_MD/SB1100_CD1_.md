# A BILL FOR AN ACT

# RELATING TO INSURANCE DATA SECURITY

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:

The legislature finds that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in 2017 to strengthen existing data privacy and consumer breach notification obligations of insurance licensees. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners strongly encourages that states adopt this model law by 2022 to avoid risking federal preemption of state laws in this area.

While some licensees may already have cybersecurity policies and protocols in place, this Act will ensure and formalize insurance data security protections for all insurance licensees.

The purpose of this Act is to adopt the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Insurance Data Security Model Law to establish exclusive state standards applicable to insurance data security standards for Hawaii insurance licensees.
