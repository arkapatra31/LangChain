In this course, Lance Martin from LangChain teaches how to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance large language models (LLMs) using private data. The curriculum covers the entire RAG pipeline, including data indexing, document retrieval, and answer generation, while exploring techniques like query translation and multi-query approaches. Advanced methods such as hierarchical indexing and corrective RAG are also discussed to improve retrieval accuracy. The course aims to equip learners with practical skills to build effective RAG systems that integrate public and private data.
