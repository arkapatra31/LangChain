In this course, Lance Martin, a software engineer at LangChain, teaches how to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from scratch. RAG combines custom data with large language models (LLMs) to enhance their capabilities, especially given that most data is private while LLMs are trained on public data. The course covers the entire RAG pipeline, including indexing external data, retrieval of relevant documents, and generation of answers based on those documents. Key techniques discussed include query translation, routing to appropriate data sources, and query construction for various databases. Advanced methods such as multi-query approaches, hierarchical indexing (Raptor), and corrective RAG are also explored to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. The course emphasizes the importance of integrating private data into LLMs and the evolving landscape of RAG technology as LLMs' context windows expand.
